OpenCV 4.5.4+ is needed 

Simple file for python yolo.onnx detection to interface with cpp

Precompiled Debians for Raspberry pi 4 for c++ OpenCV 4.5.4+ can be found:
https://github.com/prepkg/opencv-raspberrypi

To recompile OpenCV 4.5.4+ for computers:
Follow this:
https://vitux.com/opencv_ubuntu/
and
https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d7/d9f/tutorial_linux_install.html

I think the following also need to be installed

sudo apt-get install python3-pip

pip3 install python-config
pip3 install os-sys
pip3 install syspath
